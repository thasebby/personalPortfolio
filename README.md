# Sebastian Saenz Personal Portfolio

## Description

By creating this online portfolio, I am giving myself the opportunity to share projects I have worked and all of my personal information with companies I would be interested in working for. Having a portfolio that i can work on for the next six months is a great way to practice on my web development skills. It also gives me something to look forward to fixing and see grow.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The main purpose of this website is to have a hub where I can easily share information on my career up to this point. There is still much that needs to be fixed in regards to interactivity but it is a great place to start.
